# starfield-modding-misc-extract
This repo is a direct copy of starfields `misc.ba2`, which has been extracted by [Hexabit B.A.E.](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/165), then decompiled by [Champollion](https://github.com/Orvid/Champollion), to reveal all raw `.psc` files for your papyrus modding convience. 

This is part of a series to create a startfield modding CI/CD pipeline to allow purmutated mods more easily.

# how do i use this?
this can be used in place of going through the task of extracting and decompiling on your own. this can be imported into a pipeline (one day)

# i've never modded anything before in my life, how do i use this?
if you have no programming or related experience, you may find some of the requirements of papyrus modding to be challanging.

but don't let this stop you if you really want to see something done. 

this guide: [[Tutorial] Papyrus for Beginners](http://www.cipscis.com/skyrim/tutorials/beginners.aspx) will give you some of the basics of papyrus. its written for skyrim but skyrim and starfield are very closely related.

after this, you could look at decompiling on your own (its good to learn) using this starfield specific mod/guide: [Papyrus decompile and compile command files](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3921)
